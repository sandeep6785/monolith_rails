Hi Sandeep!

This is the Rails repository that you will work on.

**NEXT STEPS**:

1. Take the HTML/CSS/JS files from this repository: [Base HTML/CSS/JS File](https://github.com/kennyfrc/monolith_homepage.git)
2. Import it all into a separate "home" controller/view in this Rails application
3. Add all the gem and CSS dependencies as needed
4. Done!

I also have a couple of other projects in the pipeline. If you do well in this, I will extend our contract and include you in those projects as well.

Thanks
Kenn
